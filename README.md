## Overview
I built an interactive article preview card that displays article content with an author's avatar and a share button. When you click the share button, social media icons (Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter) appear in a nicely styled overlay. On smaller screens, the avatar section hides, and the entire bottom area becomes the share block.

### The challenge

Injected images via ```innerHTML``` were not loading correctly due to incorrect paths and syntax ‚Äî needed to fix by providing valid paths and using correct HTML structure.

Keeping the share button fixed in place while toggling the social icons.

Handling different behavior on smaller screens (hiding the avatar and adjusting the background).

Making sure JavaScript doesn‚Äôt break when elements are missing or hidden.

## My process

1Ô∏è‚É£ Planning and layout

Started by structuring the HTML, defining sections for the image, content, author info, and share button.

Focused on semantic structure for clarity.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Styling and responsiveness

Styled using CSS with flexbox for layout.

Implemented responsiveness for screens below 850px.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Adding interactivity

Used JavaScript to toggle the share icons on button click.

Handled dynamic updates (like showing/hiding avatars and changing background colors).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging and refining

Solved issues where the share button‚Äôs position would shift when toggled.

Made sure that on mobile, only the share block shows, and the avatar hides.

### Built with

- HTML: for semantic structure.

- CSS: for styling, flexbox layouts, hover states, and responsive design.

- JavaScript: for interactivity (event listeners, DOM manipulation, toggling elements).

### What I learned

‚úÖ How to dynamically inject HTML elements using innerHTML.
‚úÖ How to toggle visibility using display: flex and display: none in JavaScript.
‚úÖ How to keep an element fixed in place even when content changes.
‚úÖ How to hide and show different blocks depending on the screen size and interaction state.
‚úÖ How to improve responsive design by combining media queries and JavaScript logic.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ')
}
```
